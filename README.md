When using CCDemon, users have to keep two things in mind:
1) transfer the line delimiter of Java files to windows style (i.e., \r\n);
2) forbid Eclipse's default code indentation function by Windows>>Preferences>>Java>>Editor>>Typing>>unselect "Adjust indentation" 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
